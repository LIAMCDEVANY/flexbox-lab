# Flexbox Lab

## Introduction
In this lab, I practiced using CSS Flexbox to lay out a pre-styled webpage. The goal was to apply Flexbox properties to structure the page into a responsive layout without modifying the provided HTML structure or base styles.

## Key Concepts
- Flexbox properties applied to parent elements affect their direct children
- Flex containers can be nested to create more complex layouts
- Default element behavior changes when placed inside a flex container
- Flexbox is useful for building responsive and organized layouts

## Sections Styled
The page was broken into the following sections and styled individually using Flexbox:

1. **Nav** – aligned navigation items and action buttons
2. **Hero** – centered headers, input, and trending content using nested flex containers
3. **Sub-nav** – spaced buttons across the container
4. **Main content** – displayed cards in a wrapping flex layout with aligned footers

## Techniques Used
- `display: flex`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `flex-direction`
- `flex-wrap`
- spacing with margins and gaps
- nested flex containers
